# Who are Peacekeepers?
Peacekeepers (PKs) are a steadying force in moments of tension. Their role is to protect, not provoke, through attentive presence and emotional clarity. The requisite capabilities include:

- Empathetic communication: listening deeply and defusing with compassion
- Emotional awareness: noticing agitation, urgency, or stress before it shapes action (self-applicable)
- Physical awareness: recognizing personal needs in-field (hydration, sensory overload, mobility) and acting on them (self-applicable)
- Situational awareness: continuously observing and moving throughout complex spaces, for the duration of events
- Boundaries/Containment: understanding how harmful behaviors often seek audience, and using position, visibility, and coordination to gently block that feedback loop (like raised flags separating agitators from a crowd or receiving aggressive perspectives without internalizing or reacting to them).

PKs are not enforcers; we are anchors. We respond to intensity by grounding, not escalating, and we hold ourselves to the same care we offer others.

## Our Structure
This is a horizontal space where leadership emerges as a trait through initiative, not as a label through assignment; it means stepping up, not standing over. We self-organize, communicate authentically, and support each other empathetically- seeking to understand rather than be understood. What we build depends on presence - not control - and on each person's mindful contribution.

## What to Expect
In the field, you'll witness a spectrum of human emotion: joyous rebellion, sharp humor, confused opposition, and the pain of oppression. You may encounter trolling, intimidation, or confrontation - sometimes from individuals acting alone, sometimes from organized counter-forces, and sometimes from those who claim to protect and serve.

There will be moments that ask everything of you - to stay grounded while others escalate, to hold space while you're being challenged, to know when to stay and when to step away. But youâ€™ll also find voices rising together and a deep, unshakable sense of shared purpose.

Is this a calling you're prepared to undertake?
