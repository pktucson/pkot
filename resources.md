## Categories

### Peacekeeping Guides

- [Official PKoT Guide](https://drive.proton.me/urls/21HQNACPH0#8rw-KFFARltG)

- [XR De-escalation Workshop](https://youtu.be/8K_m40F02pU?si=rqNnUersscMxY9TC)

> This is video of an IRL workshop and adds valuable context to de-escalation practice. It's just over an hour long and has terrible audio, which is the more important part.

> This is a fantastic de-escalation handbook; perhaps a 5 minute read.

One should carry a convenience kit, with preferred items (bandaids, painkillers, topicals, etc); **This is not your IFAK.** An IFAK is carried readily accessible on your person for others to use on you (or to use on others not equipped). It is stripped down, with only trauma necessities.
