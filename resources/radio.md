## Radio Etiquette For Winners

### To perform a radio check for signal clarity:

Press and hold the transmit button for a full second, then speak nice and slow, prioritizing enunciation and proper inflection.

**Sharktank**: "Chainsaw, this is Sharktank; radio check, over!"    

**Chainsaw**: "Sharktank this is chainsaw, I read you Lima Charlie, how copy, over?" 
> *Lima charlie is LC in the phonetic alphabet, which translates to 'loud and clear'*

**Sharktank**: "Chainsaw this is Sharktank, I read you Lima Charlie, Sharktank out!" 

*At this point the conversation is over, since a proper, clear radio link has been established!*

## Extended coms use

**Charlie2**: “Bravo, this is Charlie2, priority, over.”
> *Charlie2 hails team to establish, using "priority" for urgency and channel silence*

**Bravo1**: “Charlie2, Bravo1, Go ahead Charlie2, over.”

**Charlie2**: “Bravo1, counter-protester escalation south of Romeo, break …”
> *Charlie2 has to exchange with IRLs at location and uses "break"*

**Charlie2**: “Move to assist south Romeo ASAP, read back, over.”
>*Charlie2 uses "read back" due to "break" to verify full receipt*

**Bravo1**: “I read back: Escalation at south Romeo move to assist, over.”

**Charlie2**: “Correct, over.”

**Bravo1**: “Wilco, over.”

*Bravo1 can/will comply*

**Charlie2**: “Roger, out.”

## Placename Prowords:

Points and sectors will be identified either in a briefing document and/or prior to and during the briefing. Some rally points should remain undocumented. These points will be assigned a phonetic character starting from ALPHA.

## Escalation Prowords:

Announce counter-protesters as a "**Fox in the henhouse**," giving updates on escalation as category:

- **Category 1**: Heated escalation
- **Category 2**: Aggravated escalation
- **Category 3**: Violent escalation

## Urgency Prowords:

- **WHISKEY** <placename>: rally on <placename> ASAP.

     *Eg: "All PK, this is Romeo J; Whiskey Romeo, Whiskey Romeo; AKNOWLEDGE, over."*

The following will likely have been preceded by escalation categories and indicate a pattern toward a loss of control. We start by prioritizing crowd safety and evacuation.

- **XRAY** - Retreat. Engage protesters in your sector in mobilization toward a secure position and pass the word toward this action. Do not spend too much time on resistant individuals and seek to secure the majority. 
    *Eg: "All PK, from Delta; XRAY, XRAY, XRAY; Confirmed; XRAY, XRAY, XRAY from Delta; over"*

- **YANKY** - Be the mist. Disperse to regroup at a given rally point. Regroup rally points are given at morning briefing, in person, and/or dynamically updated via radio.

- **Zulu** - RUN. Break line of site and change appearance and story. Proceed calmly in acting your story in a route taking you a significant distance (miles and intention) from your origin. Do not regroup.

## Emergency Signal:

**3 bursts of anything (airhorn, whistle, etc.) means rally on the origin immediately!**

**Reminder:** End time minus 15 minutes wrap up will be announced over radio (Eg: "T-15, T-15, wrap your sector"). Engage your sector, conveying that PK Support will be finishing at the end time, we are grateful for them and our movement, and they are free to continuing exercising their right to protest without us. At events where applicable, mention parking or other such nuances.
