        <p>We provide day-of safety support at community events. This form helps us understand your plans and determine how
            we can assist.</p>
        <p>We're not event organizers, but weâ€™re happy to offer safety-related insights if invited during the planning
            process. Our universal recommendations include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invite participants with mobility needs to lead marches or processions. This helps maintain consistent
                pacing and reduces gaps, which can pose safety risks and increase vulnerability to counter-protesters or law
                enforcement intervention.</li>
            <li>Designate and share locations for water and medic stations. Including these on any maps improves
                coordination and emergency response.</li>
            <li>Have a program or schedule with speaker order, timing, and cues. This helps events stay on track and reduces
                confusion or early movement.</li>
            <li>Use maps and establish communications. Knowing who is where and how to reach them is vital. We can provide
                radios to key contacts to support live coordination.</li>
            <li>Start on time. Delays can lead to confusion, tension, and disorganized movement, which may increase risk.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also aim to ensure no care provider is stationed alone and offer to pair up where needed.</p>
