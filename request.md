# Support Request
We provide day-of safety support at community events. This form helps us understand your plans and determine how we can assist.

We're not event organizers, but weâ€™re happy to offer safety-related insights if invited during the planning process. Our universal recommendations include the following:

- Invite participants with mobility needs to lead marches or processions. This helps maintain consistent pacing and reduces gaps, which can pose safety risks and increase vulnerability to counter-protesters or law enforcement intervention.
- Designate and share locations for water and medic stations. Including these on any maps improves coordination and emergency response.
- Have a program or schedule with speaker order, timing, and cues. This helps events stay on track and reduces confusion or early movement.
- Use maps and establish communications. Knowing who is where and how to reach them is vital. We can provide radios to key contacts to support live coordination.
- Start on time. Delays can lead to confusion, tension, and disorganized movement, which may increase risk.

We also aim to ensure no care provider is stationed alone and offer to pair up where needed.
